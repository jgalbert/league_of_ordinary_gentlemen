    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of players and draft picks (up to 3 drafts away) are allowed. Trades will process immediately and will only be reversed under investigation for collusion. Tradable assets include players, draft picks, and FAAB.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owner's team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. Punishment can include any/all combination of FAAB reduction, a freeze on all transactions, and removal from the league.</p>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>Lending players is considered a form of collusion and any teams involved in this behavior will be subject to the aforementioned collusion punishments.</p>

    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>You will not be able to trade draft picks that are more than 3 drafts away. For example, during the 2021 season you cannot trade any picks in or after the 2025 draft. You may only trade FAAB from the current season.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>
    
    <p>The league will utilize a FAAB waiver wire system. All teams will have their budget reset to $100 twice per year: Once after the final pre-season game and before the Thursday game of the 1st NFL week and then immediately following the Fantasy Championship game. $0 bids are allowed. Bids will process at 12:00 PM EST Tuesday - Sunday.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2 Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year will be a linear draft following the rules below:<br></p>
    <p>The six teams that qualify for the playoffs will draft in reverse order of their finish with 1st place drafting 12th and 6th place drafting 7th.<br>
       The six teams that do not qualify for the playoffs will draft in reverse order of their cumulative season long best ball score. Cumulative season long best ball score is defined as: Each week of the regular season, a team's best starting lineup based on if they had made perfect start-sit decisions will be calculated and summed for the entire 14 week regular season. </p>

    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Rookie Drafts</h3>
    <p>Rookie drafts will consist of a 4 round draft including only incoming NFL rookies. Each pick will be alloted 4 hours to make a selection at which point the system will auto draft a player. The draft will start at 8:00 AM EST on the Monday immediately following the NFL draft and will pause each night from 11:00 PM EST until 8:00 AM EST. No additional slots will be added to make room for rookies. Following the draft, teams are expected to drop players until they comply with team roster composition within a reasonable timeframe. While rosters are over the team composition limit, they will be blocked from performing any team actions including trades, waivers, and start/sit decisions with the exclusion of dropping players until they comply with roster composition limits.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>Trading is allowed throughout the draft including the current draft pick.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical PPR Scoring).</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. Each team that wins their division and the 4 wild card teams that finish with the best records, will receive a playoff berth. The 2 teams that win their division will receive a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will last one week and will be handled in a single elimination fashion. Week 18 of the NFL schedule will not be utilized for fantasy purposes.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Points For</li>
        <li>Head-to-Head Record</li>
        <li>Division Record</li>
        <li>Total Points Against</li>
        <li>Coin Flip</li>
        <li>Duel to the death</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. The first time this happens will incur a verbal warning. Subsequent violations will be subject to punishment up to and including removal from the league.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of refusing to pay league dues in a timely manner, continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally not grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, co-managers will be offered the team in order of joining the league. Assuming no co-manager is selected, the commissioner will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be active within the league.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected through <a href="https://www.venmo.com/u/jalbert4">Venmo @ jalbert4</a> and collection will be expected prior to the start of the NFL Draft.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: ${dues * 6.5}</li>
        <li>2nd place: ${dues * 3}</li>
        <li>3rd place: ${dues * 1.5}</li>
        <li>4th place: ${dues}</li>
    </ul>
